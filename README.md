# CodSoft-Task3
# Iris Classification Machine Learning Project
This repository contains a machine learning project that focuses on classifying the famous Iris dataset using Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Decision Tree classifiers. The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community, and this project demonstrates how to build and evaluate two different classifiers to predict the species of iris flowers.

# Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to classify iris flowers into their respective species, namely:
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica
Two different machine learning classifiers, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Decision Trees, are implemented to accomplish this classification task. These classifiers are trained on the Iris dataset and their performance is evaluated.

# Dataset
The Iris dataset used in this project is a popular dataset for machine learning classification tasks. It contains 150 samples of iris flowers, with 50 samples from each of the three species. Each sample has four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The dataset is included in scikit-learn and can be easily loaded for analysis and model training.

# Dependencies
To run this project, you will need the following Python libraries:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib.pyplot
- seaborn
- Scikit-Learn (sklearn)

# SVM Classifier
The SVM classifier is implemented in the Jupyter notebook and is trained using the Iris dataset. It leverages the scikit-learn library to create and evaluate the SVM model. The code and results can be found in the notebook.

# Decision Tree Classifier
Similar to the SVM classifier, the Decision Tree classifier is implemented and trained in the Jupyter notebook. The notebook explains the steps to create the model and assess its performance.

# Evaluation
The project includes an evaluation section that measures the performance of both classifiers using metrics like accuracy, and precision. The results are discussed in the Jupyter notebook.
